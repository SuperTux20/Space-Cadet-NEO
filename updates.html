			<h3>Update Log</h3>
			<h5>Most recent entries are at the top</h5>
			<ul>
				<li class="log">Revamped original Space Cadet sounds by inporting them into Audacity, setting sample rate of track and project to 44100Hz, and slowing down to 25%. This makes the audio sound a bit crisper.</li>
				<li class="log">Music is complete. There are two versions, one that sounds like the original with better instruments, and another one with more instrument tracks.</li>
				<li class="log">Music Draft 4 made. Effects have been added.</li>
				<li class="log">Music Draft 3 made. Song length has doubled.</li>
				<li class="log">Music Draft 2 made. More instruments have been added.</li>
				<li class="log">Music Draft 1 made. Sounds a lot like the original.</li>
				<li class="log">Idea has been formulated. Space Cadet NEO is now a thing.</li>
